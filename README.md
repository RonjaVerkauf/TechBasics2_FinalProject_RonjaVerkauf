# Bisycle secrurity device
My Final project is a bisycle secrurity device. The setup includes an ESP32 which allows the device to have wifi accass. It also contains of movement detector, an SD card reader, a RFID and a buzzer which allows the device to have two different main functions:
1. When the bisycle is being moved but the secrurity device isn't connected to the users phone's wifi, the buzzer makes a loud alarm.
2. When the bisycle is being moved and the secrurity device is connected to the users phone's wifi, the buzzer stayes silent and the user gets an alarm sent to his phone thorugh E-Mail.
The RFID allowed the owner to turn the device on and off and ensures that no one else (for example a thief) can turn of the device before moving the bisycle. The whole thing is powered by a USB power bank.
